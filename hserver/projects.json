How ever recently I have been spening more time on this, there is definetly a place for it in rapid throw away scripts and personal procject. The speed up of having a custom written langauge can really add up"

The car can be controlled over wifi in manual or automated mode. I built a system that uses a kalmen filter with the ir sensors and camera for navigation. In the future I intend to attach a cheap 360 lidar I purchased to get realtime inforamtion on its environment. Ultimately I want to train up some deep reinforcement models and the ability to map environment so the car can opterate autonomously"

A lot of what I did is available for free in arduino pilot and other open source projects. The point however was to learn and I think I achieved this. In the future id like to add the lidar.",

The trick is setting them up to be reliable and figuring out how to combine the data, a kalmen filter works quite well. Even with good knowledge of the environment giving the systems good decision making abilities is hard, I started off with decission tress and moved into classic AI concepts. Now I am looking more and more into Deep reinforcement learning approaches",
