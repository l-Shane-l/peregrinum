      <p>
        Over the years, I've built a number of drones, including cars that are
        driven by plain Arduinos. Initially, I had access to a CNC and a 3D
        printer I built, which greatly facilitated these projects. However,
        since moving a few years ago and facing space constraints, my setup has
        become more modest.
