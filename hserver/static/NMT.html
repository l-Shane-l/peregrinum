      <p>
        This is a project in which I used Marian NMT with a bit of perl and
        haskell to scrape data from the EU records to find documents in both
        Irish and English, then I used these matching sentence pairs around 5
        million to train up a translation model over a few days using a new GPU
        i bought at the time. The model was pretty good considering the
        resources I dedicated it outperformed google translate for Irish
        performance from around 2012. The most difficult part was finding the
        language pairs, Irish is not represented much online, it was only
        because the EU recognises it as an official Language that the
        translation from treaties and debates are available.
