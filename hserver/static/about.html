      <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
        I'm a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of diverse
        experience ranging from embedded systems to full-stack development. My
        love for C++ and functional programming languages like Haskell and Perl
        runs deep, reflecting in the quality and efficiency of my code. My
        ability to seamlessly blend technical skills with creative
        problem-solving is demonstrated by my long-term project, Beatspeakâ€”a
        cutting-edge app that tracks users' heart rate through video analytics.
        Looking for opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in C++ and
        functional programming to create innovative, impactful solutions.
