      <p>
        This project began in college as a wearable sensor and has evolved into
        a non-contact version using MIT research principles. It incorporates
        OpenCV in a multithreaded environment, blending digital signal
        processing with linear algebra.

      <p>
        Recently, the use of supervised learning has improved system
        performance, making it more efficient in noise handling. Efforts are
        ongoing to prepare Beatspeak for open-sourcing.
